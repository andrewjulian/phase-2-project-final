On the Projects page, you can review un-completed projects and view them by "status" using the NestedRoutes controlled by the links for each status type.

You can also change the status of the project via the drop down menu and/or mark the project as complete using the check box. Changing the status will result in where it is sorted and viable via the NestedRoutes in the projects page or if it is viewable on the completed projects page.
